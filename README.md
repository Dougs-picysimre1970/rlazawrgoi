Oh man, just what have I walked out of? Nonnas was an absolute whirlwind, you know that feeling when you’re trying to remember a dream but it’s just slipping through your fingers? That’s me right now, sitting here on this rickety bench with my back killing me and popcorn bits playing hide and seek in the folds of my scarf. The   was like a crazy quilt of memories stitched with too-bright thread — bits and pieces that made you laugh out loud and others that hit nerve endings you didn’t know existed.

Grandmas, everywhere. Not the actual grandmas, of course, but the, the essence of nonnas, you know? That bit where the whole dining table scene exploded into a dance-off, I swear, it felt like I’d slipped into an alternate universe where lasagna was currency and you paid in layers. My brain’s still trying to process how they pulled off that cha-cha with candelabras. How they bent time with just a shake of their hip and a twirl of spaghetti. Maybe it’s just me hallucinating after the caramel popcorn overdose? 

> Oh, and that one part! The nonna with the telescope, right? How she stared at the moon like she was reading the nightly news off its craters. I couldn't help but think, is that what I look like when I’m trying to understand astrophysics after a bottle of wine? Just as lost and starry-eyed. That’s all acting, I suppose, but dang it, it was like catching a glimpse of pure magic wrapped in a shawl. 

I guess I should’ve marked down the dialogue, but who has time to jot notes when you're too busy drowning in laughter and tears at the same time? The theater was somber and loud all at once — like everyone was sharing in this vivid tapestry, breathing in unison and chomping noisily on their own thoughts. Nonnas made it feel like reality was ticking off spaghetti sauce as a highlighter, coloring moments to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   in my mind to replay in the future. It was like that time my washing machine did a jig in the middle of the night — unsettling yet fascinating.

Honestly, I can’t even put it into words whether it was a comedic masterpiece or a poignant exploration of life. Maybe both? Maybe neither? Sometimes it’s like a childhood memory surfacing unexpectedly and I just don’t know. You absolutely have to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   — everyone deserves to see grandmothers turn into these mythological creatures of comfort and chaos. 

I should probably rerun it, you know, 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   or something, as if there’s something I missed amidst the riot of old-school laughter and echoes of kitchen clatter. Too many strands of the storyline were like scrambled Patagonian wind patterns whirlin’ in my noggin’.

def nonna_twins():
    for i in range(wisdom):
        lasagna -= cha_cha
    return moon.large_telescope 

And then my brain just flatlines.
